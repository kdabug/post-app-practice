Let's make a cool new app called ***TWEEDR***!! Not Twitter, geez...

### What you will do:

- Write out your [specs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-octonion/debug-game-hanoi/readme.md#Program-Specs-and-Planning)
- Wireframe the mockup into the components you want to have

- Sketch out your component hierarchy showing the data flow: 

        - what methods will your app have and which components will they be defined in
        - Which components will be stateful
        - What props will be passed down to each component
       
### Bonus2

- Write user stories
- Make a project board with the code tasks from your user stories
